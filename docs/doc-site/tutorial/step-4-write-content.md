# Step 4: Write content

Generate documentation samples with AI collaboration.

## Complete these tasks

By the end of this step, you will have:

- 3-5 complete documentation samples
- Different documentation types represented
- AI-generated content reviewed for accuracy
- Case studies documenting your process

## Time estimate

2-3 hours

## Generate project pages with the script

For each project in your `profile.yaml`, the content generation script creates a project showcase page:

```bash
# From 02-doc-site-portfolio/
python scripts/generate_content.py \
  --page project \
  --project "Developer Portal" \
  --profile profile.yaml \
  --output my-portfolio/docs/projects/developer-portal.md
```

Replace `"Developer Portal"` with a project name from your `profile.yaml`. Repeat for each project you want to showcase.

To see what happens without API calls:

```bash
python scripts/generate_content.py --page project --project "Developer Portal" --sample
```

Review the output carefully. Add specific details the script couldn't know — exact metrics, stakeholder names, tools you used, and anything that reflects your actual contribution.

### Option C: Use Claude Code CLI

In your terminal Claude Code session, prompt:

```
Read profile.yaml and create a project showcase page for the "Developer Portal" project.
Write the result to docs/projects/developer-portal.md.
Include sections for project context, documentation approach, AI collaboration details,
and skills demonstrated.
```

Repeat for each project you want to showcase, changing the project name and output file each time.

The sections below cover generating documentation samples (API references, tutorials, CLI docs) using manual prompting, since these require detailed technical content that you define.

## Overview of AI collaboration approach

This step teaches you to collaborate with AI effectively for different documentation types. You will learn:

- Specific prompting techniques for each doc type
- How to structure prompts for best results
- When to use AI generation versus editing
- How to verify and improve AI output

## Principle: Start with structure, then fill content

The most effective approach:

1. Define the structure and outline yourself
2. Use AI to generate initial content for each section
3. Review and edit for accuracy and tone
4. Add examples and specifics manually
5. Iterate based on quality

Do not: Ask AI to "write complete documentation" without structure.  
Do: Provide detailed outlines and generate section-by-section.

> **Path C users**: The prompts in the sections below are formatted for any AI interface. To use them with Claude Code CLI, paste the prompt directly into your terminal session and add a line telling Claude where to write the output — for example: `"Write the result to docs/samples/api-reference.md."` Claude will create or update the file directly, so you can skip any copy-paste steps.

## Documentation type 1: API reference

API reference documentation requires precision and completeness.

### Create the structure first

Plan your API endpoints before generating content:

```markdown
# EventStream API Reference

## Overview
[Description of API purpose]

## Authentication
[How to authenticate]

## Base URL
[API base URL and versioning]

## Endpoints

### POST /events
[Endpoint details]

### GET /events/{id}
[Endpoint details]

### DELETE /events/{id}
[Endpoint details]

## Response codes
[HTTP status codes]

## Rate limiting
[Rate limit information]

## Examples
[Complete request/response examples]
```

### Prompt for API endpoint documentation

Create `prompts/api-endpoint-prompt.md`:

```markdown
Generate API reference documentation for this endpoint:

## Endpoint details
- Method: POST
- Path: /events
- Purpose: Create a new event in the EventStream system
- Authentication: Required (Bearer token)

## Request parameters

Body parameters:
- name (string, required): Event name
- type (string, required): Event type (webhook, scheduled, manual)
- payload (object, required): Event data
- timestamp (string, optional): ISO 8601 timestamp

## Response

Success (201):
- Returns created event object with ID
- Includes: id, name, type, payload, timestamp, created_at

Error responses:
- 400: Invalid parameters
- 401: Authentication failed
- 429: Rate limit exceeded

## Example

Request:
```json
{
  "name": "user.created",
  "type": "webhook",
  "payload": {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }
}
```

Response (201):
```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "name": "user.created",
  "type": "webhook",
  "payload": {
    "user_id": "12345",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Generate clear, concise API reference documentation for this endpoint. 
Use standard API documentation format with sections for:
- Description
- Authentication
- Parameters
- Response format
- Error handling
- Example request and response

Target audience: Backend developers integrating this API
Tone: Technical, precise, professional
```

### Generate and review

1. Send prompt to your AI provider
2. Review generated content for:
   - Technical accuracy
   - Completeness (all parameters documented)
   - Consistent formatting
   - Clear examples
3. Add or correct details AI might have invented
4. Verify JSON syntax in examples

### What to check manually

AI often makes these mistakes in API docs:
- Invents parameter names not in your spec
- Inconsistent data types
- Missing required versus optional distinction
- Unrealistic example values
- Incomplete error handling

Always verify against your planned API structure.

## Documentation type 2: Getting started guide

Getting started guides need clear steps and user empathy.

### Structure the learning path

Plan the user journey:

```markdown
# Getting Started with Docker

## What you will learn
[Learning objectives]

## Prerequisites
[What users need before starting]

## Step 1: Install Docker
[Installation instructions]

## Step 2: Verify installation
[How to confirm it works]

## Step 3: Run your first container
[Simple, successful first experience]

## Step 4: Understand what happened
[Explain the concepts]

## Next steps
[Where to go from here]
```

### Prompt for getting started content

```markdown
Generate a "Getting Started" guide section with these requirements:

## Topic
Installing Docker on macOS

## Target audience
Developers new to Docker with basic command line experience

## Learning objective
User successfully installs Docker and runs their first container

## Key points to cover
- Installation via Homebrew (preferred method)
- Alternative: Docker Desktop download
- Verification steps
- Simple "hello world" container
- Explanation of what happened

## Tone
- Encouraging and supportive
- Assumes no prior Docker knowledge
- Celebrates small wins
- Anticipates common questions

## Format requirements
- Step-by-step numbered instructions
- Expected output shown for each command
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues
- Clear "success criteria" for each step

Generate the installation and verification section only. I will add 
the container running section separately.
```

### Effective techniques for tutorials

Use these approaches for better tutorial content:

**Show expected output**:
```markdown
Run the verification command:

```bash
docker --version
```

Expected output:
```
Docker version 24.0.6, build ed223bc
```
```

**Anticipate problems**:
```markdown
If you see "command not found":
- Restart your terminal
- Verify installation with: `which docker`
- Check PATH includes `/usr/local/bin`
```

**Celebrate progress**:
```markdown
✓ Docker is installed and ready to use!
```

## Documentation type 3: CLI reference

CLI documentation requires comprehensive command coverage.

### Structure command documentation

```markdown
# git-deploy CLI Reference

## Synopsis
git-deploy [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

## Description
[What this tool does]

## Global options
[Options that apply to all commands]

## Commands

### git-deploy init
[Command details]

### git-deploy push
[Command details]

### git-deploy status
[Command details]

## Exit codes
[What different exit codes mean]

## Examples
[Real-world usage examples]
```

### Prompt for CLI command documentation

```markdown
Generate CLI reference documentation for this command:

## Command
git-deploy push

## Purpose
Deploy code to specified environment

## Usage
git-deploy push [OPTIONS] <environment>

## Arguments
- environment (required): Target environment (staging, production)

## Options
- `--branch <name>`: Deploy specific branch (default: current branch)
- `--force`: Force deployment (skip checks)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be deployed without deploying
- `--verbose`: Show detailed output

## Behavior
1. Validates current branch is clean
2. Runs tests if configured
3. Builds deployment package
4. Pushes to target environment
5. Runs post-deploy checks

## Exit codes
- 0: Success
- 1: Validation failed
- 2: Tests failed
- 3: Deployment failed

## Examples needed
- Basic deployment to staging
- Force deployment to production
- Dry run to see what would deploy

Generate comprehensive CLI reference documentation.
Format: Standard man page style with clear sections.
Include all options with short and long forms.
Examples should be realistic and well-explained.
```

### CLI documentation best practices

**Use consistent formatting**:
```markdown
### Options

`-b, --branch <name>`
: Deploy specific Git branch instead of current branch.

`-f, --force`
: Skip safety checks and force deployment. Use with caution.

`-n, --dry-run`
: Show deployment plan without executing. Safe to run in production.
```

**Show complete examples**:
```markdown
Deploy current branch to staging:
```bash
git-deploy push staging
```

Deploy specific branch to production with verbose output:
```bash
git-deploy push --branch release-1.2 --verbose production
```
```

## Documentation type 4: Troubleshooting guide

Troubleshooting docs help users solve problems independently.

### Structure problem-solution format

```markdown

- Educational (explain why this happens)
- Practical (clear steps to fix)

Generate complete troubleshooting entry with:
- Clear symptom description
- Root cause explanation
- Step-by-step solution with commands
- Prevention guidance
```

### Troubleshooting documentation patterns

**Use consistent structure**:
```markdown
### Problem: Container fails to start

**Symptoms**:
- `docker start` command hangs
- No error message displayed
- Container status shows "Exited"

**Common causes**:
- Application error in container
- Missing environment variables
- Port conflict

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check container logs
docker logs container-name

# Check container details
docker inspect container-name
```

**Solutions**:

If logs show missing environment variable:
```bash
docker rm container-name
docker run -e VAR=value image-name
```

If port conflict:
```bash
docker rm container-name
docker run -p 8081:80 image-name
```

**Prevention**:
- Always check logs first: `docker logs`
- Use `--rm` flag for temporary containers
- Document required environment variables
```
