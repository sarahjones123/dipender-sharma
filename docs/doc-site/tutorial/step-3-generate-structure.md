# Step 3: Generate structure

Create your site navigation and page templates with AI assistance.

## Complete these tasks

By the end of this step, you will have:

- Site navigation configured in `mkdocs.yml`
- Page templates created for all documentation samples
- Project showcase structure established
- Homepage drafted

## Time estimate

45-60 minutes

## Generate navigation with the script

If you completed your `profile.yaml` in Step 2, the fastest way to get a starting nav structure is to run the content generation script:

```bash
# From 02-doc-site-portfolio/
python scripts/generate_content.py \
  --page structure \
  --profile profile.yaml
```

The script outputs a `nav:` YAML block based on your background plus a short rationale explaining the suggested structure. Copy the `nav:` block into your `mkdocs.yml`.

To test without a profile file:

```bash
python scripts/generate_content.py --page structure --sample
```

The manual approach below gives you more control over the structure if you prefer to plan it yourself.

### Option C: Use Claude Code CLI

In your terminal Claude Code session, prompt:

```
Read profile.yaml and suggest a nav structure for my MkDocs portfolio site.
Format the output as a nav: block I can paste into mkdocs.yml.
```

Claude will read your profile and generate a nav structure with a short rationale. Copy the `nav:` block into your `mkdocs.yml`.

## Plan your navigation structure

Good navigation shows information architecture skills. Plan a structure that highlights your documentation samples.

### Recommended structure

```
Home (index.md)
├── About (about.md)
├── Projects (projects/)
│   ├── Overview (index.md)
│   ├── Project 1 (project-1.md)
│   ├── Project 2 (project-2.md)
│   └── Project 3 (project-3.md)
├── Samples (samples/)
│   ├── Overview (index.md)
│   ├── API Reference (api-reference.md)
│   ├── Getting Started (getting-started.md)
│   ├── CLI Reference (cli-reference.md)
│   ├── Tutorial (tutorial.md)
│   └── Troubleshooting (troubleshooting.md)
└── Contact (contact.md)
```

### Alternative structure (documentation-type focused)

```
Home (index.md)
├── About (about.md)
├── API Documentation (api-docs/)
│   ├── REST API Reference (rest-api.md)
│   └── Webhooks Guide (webhooks.md)
├── Tutorials (tutorials/)
│   ├── Getting Started (getting-started.md)
│   └── Advanced Features (advanced.md)
├── Reference (reference/)
│   ├── CLI Commands (cli.md)
│   └── Configuration (config.md)
└── Contact (contact.md)
```

Choose the structure that best showcases your planned documentation types.

## Configure navigation in mkdocs.yml

Open `mkdocs.yml` and update the `nav` section:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - About: about.md
  - Projects:
      - Overview: projects/index.md
      - EventStream API: projects/eventstream-api.md
      - Docker Guide: projects/docker-guide.md
      - Git CLI Reference: projects/git-cli.md
  - Samples:
      - Overview: samples/index.md
      - API Reference: samples/api-reference.md
      - Getting Started: samples/getting-started.md
      - CLI Reference: samples/cli-reference.md
      - Troubleshooting: samples/troubleshooting.md
  - Contact: contact.md
```

Adjust based on your planning document from Step 2.

## Create directory structure

Create all necessary directories and placeholder files:

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p docs/projects
mkdir -p docs/samples

# Create project pages
touch docs/projects/index.md
touch docs/projects/eventstream-api.md
touch docs/projects/docker-guide.md
touch docs/projects/git-cli.md

# Create sample pages
touch docs/samples/index.md
touch docs/samples/api-reference.md
touch docs/samples/getting-started.md
touch docs/samples/cli-reference.md
touch docs/samples/troubleshooting.md

# Create other pages
touch docs/contact.md
```

Adjust filenames to match your planned documentation samples.

## Use AI to draft your homepage

### Option A: Use the script

```bash
# From 02-doc-site-portfolio/
python scripts/generate_content.py \
  --page home \
  --profile profile.yaml \
  --output my-portfolio/docs/index.md
```

Review the output and personalize any details that don't sound like you.

### Option B: Manual prompt approach

Create a prompt that generates your homepage content. Save this prompt for transparency in your portfolio.

### Option C: Use Claude Code CLI

In your terminal Claude Code session, prompt:

```
Read profile.yaml and create a homepage for my technical writing portfolio.
Write the result to docs/index.md.
Tone: professional but approachable. Include sections for skills, portfolio
highlights, and a call to action.
```

Claude writes the file directly. Open it, review, and edit anything that doesn't sound like you.

### Example prompt

Create `prompts/homepage-prompt.md`:

```markdown
# Homepage Generation Prompt

Create a homepage for a technical writing portfolio site with these requirements:

## About me
- Technical writer with [X] years of experience
- Specialization in [API documentation / developer tools / etc.]
- Background in [relevant industry or technology]

## Key skills to highlight
- API documentation
- Developer experience (DevEx)
- Docs-as-code workflows
- Technical tutorials
- Information architecture

## Portfolio contents
This site includes:
- [List your planned documentation types]
- Case studies explaining approach to each sample
- Examples of API reference, tutorials, CLI docs, troubleshooting guides

## Tone
- Professional but approachable
- Confident without being boastful
- Clear and concise
- Technical credibility

## Call to action
- Review documentation samples
- View projects
- Download resume
- Contact for opportunities

Generate the homepage content in Markdown format suitable for MkDocs.
```

### Generate content with AI

Use your AI provider to generate the content:

**Using Claude (via CLI or web interface)**:
```
I need help creating a homepage for my technical writing portfolio. 
[Paste your prompt from above]
```

**Using ChatGPT**:
```
I am creating a technical writing portfolio site. Please generate homepage content based on these requirements:
[Paste your prompt from above]
```

### Review and customize output

AI will generate something like:

```markdown

## Use AI to generate about page

Your about page should be professional and highlight relevant experience.

### Option A: Use the script

```bash
# From 02-doc-site-portfolio/
python scripts/generate_content.py \
  --page about \
  --profile profile.yaml \
  --output my-portfolio/docs/about.md
```

### Option B: Manual prompt approach

### Option C: Use Claude Code CLI

In your terminal Claude Code session, prompt:

```
Read profile.yaml and create a professional About page for my portfolio.
Write the result to docs/about.md.
Include sections for background, specializations, documentation approach,
and a note about how I use AI in my work.
```

Claude writes the file directly. Review and personalize any details.

### Prompt for about page

```markdown
Create an "About" page for a technical writing portfolio with these details:

## Test your structure

Run your local server and verify navigation:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Check that:
- All navigation links work
- No 404 errors for planned pages
- Structure makes logical sense
- Breadcrumbs display correctly

## Summary

You completed these tasks:

- ✓ Generated site nav structure (script or manual)
- ✓ Configured `mkdocs.yml` with navigation
- ✓ Created directory structure and placeholder files
- ✓ Generated homepage content with AI
- ✓ Created templates for projects and samples
- ✓ Generated about and contact pages
- ✓ Tested site structure locally

Your site now has a complete structure ready for content.

## Save your prompts

Create a `prompts/` directory to track all AI prompts used:

```bash
mkdir prompts
```

Save each prompt you used:
- `prompts/homepage-prompt.md`
- `prompts/about-page-prompt.md`
- `prompts/project-template-prompt.md`

This demonstrates transparency and process documentation skills.
