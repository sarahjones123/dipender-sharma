# Prompt evolution example

This page shows the journey of refining a release notes categorization prompt from simple to production-ready.

## Journey: Simple to refined

### Version 1: Initial (simple)

First attempt after documenting manual process

Approach: Basic categories with minimal guidance

```
Categorize GitHub commits as:
- New Features: New capabilities
- Enhancements: Improvements
- Bug Fixes: Corrections
- Documentation: Docs updates

Commits:
{COMMITS}
```

Results:

- Basic categorization working
- 35% of commits miscategorized
- Internal changes included
- Feature versus Enhancement boundary unclear
- No exclusion logic

Accuracy: 65% - Not usable

---

### Version 2: Add definitions

After reviewing first test results

Changes: Added clearer category definitions

```
Categorize GitHub commits as:

Categories:
- New Features: Wholly new capabilities that didn't exist before
- Enhancements: Improvements to existing features  
- Bug Fixes: Corrections to existing functionality
- Documentation: Content updates, typo fixes, documentation improvements

Exclusions:
- Internal tooling changes
- Work-in-progress commits
- Merge commits

Commits:
{COMMITS}
```

Results:

- Better feature or enhancement distinction
- Some internal changes filtered
- Many edge case confusions
- "Wholly new" versus "existing" ambiguous
- Exclusions too vague

Accuracy: 72% - Improved but not production-ready

---

### Version 3: Add examples

After seeing specific patterns of confusion

Changes: Added concrete examples of each category

```
Categorize GitHub commits for release notes.

Categories with examples:

**New Features** - Wholly new capabilities
Examples: "Add user authentication", "Create dashboard view"
Not examples: "Improve search" (enhancement)

**Enhancements** - Improvements to existing
Examples: "Improve search performance", "Update API format"
Not examples: "Add search feature" (new feature)

**Bug Fixes** - Corrections only
Examples: "Fix memory leak", "Resolve timeout"
Not examples: "Improve performance" (enhancement)

**Documentation** - Content updates
Examples: "Update API docs", "Fix typo in README"

Exclusions (do not include):
- Commits containing: "WIP", "temp", "test only"
- Commits starting with: "Merge pull request", "chore:"
- Internal tooling changes

Commits:
{COMMITS}

Format:
## New Features
- [commit message]

## Enhancements
- [commit message]

## Bug Fixes
- [commit message]

## Documentation
- [commit message]
```

Results:

- Feature versus Enhancement much clearer
- Better exclusion of WIP commits
- More consistent categorization
- Some internal changes leaking
- Test-related commits sometimes included

Accuracy: 83% - Getting close

---

### Version 4: Refined production

After several test runs on different repositories

Changes: Added keyword indicators, comprehensive exclusions, and format specifications

```
You are helping categorize GitHub commits for release notes.

Review the following commits and categorize each one according to these standards:

## Categories

### New Features
**Definition:** Wholly new capabilities that didn't exist before

**Examples:**
- "Add user authentication system" (Correct)
- "Create new dashboard view" (Correct)
- "Introduce webhook support" (Correct)

**NOT Examples:**
- "Improve existing search" (This is an enhancement)
- "Update authentication flow" (Enhancement to existing)

**Keywords:** "add", "new", "create", "introduce", "implement"
(Only if describing wholly new functionality)

### Enhancements
**Definition:** Improvements to existing features or functionality

**Examples:**
- "Improve search performance by 50%" (Correct)
- "Update API response format" (Correct)
- "Optimize database queries" (Correct)

**NOT Examples:**
- "Add search feature" (New feature)
- "Fix search bug" (Bug fix)

**Keywords:** "improve", "update", "enhance", "optimize", "increase", "better", "refactor"

### Bug Fixes
**Definition:** Corrections to existing functionality that wasn't working as intended

**Examples:**
- "Fix memory leak in parser" (Correct)
- "Resolve login timeout issue" (Correct)
- "Correct validation logic error" (Correct)

**NOT Examples:**
- "Improve validation performance" (Enhancement)
- "Add validation to new field" (Part of new feature)

**Keywords:** "fix", "bug", "resolve", "issue", "correct", "repair", "hotfix", "patch"

### Documentation
**Definition:** Updates to documentation, guides, or API docs

**Examples:**
- "Update API documentation" (Correct)
- "Fix typo in README" (Correct)
- "Add usage examples to guide" (Correct)

**Keywords:** "docs", "documentation", "readme", "guide", "typo" (in docs)

## Exclusions

**Do NOT include commits that:**

**By keywords:**
- Contain: "WIP", "wip", "work in progress", "temp", "temporary"
- Contain: "test only", "testing", "test coverage" (unless adding new test features for users)
- Contain: "internal", "internal only", "for team", "do not publish"

**By commit prefix:**
- Start with: "Merge pull request", "Merge branch"
- Start with: "chore:", "ci:", "build:", "test:", "style:"
- Start with: "Revert", "Bump version", "Update dependencies"

**By file paths:**
- Only change files in: /tests/, /test/, /__tests__/
- Only change files in: /internal/, /scripts/, /.github/, /.ci/
- Only change: package-lock.json, Gemfile.lock, yarn.lock, poetry.lock

**By author:**
- Commits by bots: dependabot[bot], renovate[bot], github-actions[bot]

**By change type:**
- Only formatting changes (prettier, linting, whitespace)
- Only comment updates (unless in documentation files)

## Decision Rules

When keywords conflict (e.g., "add improvement to existing feature"):

1. **Is this a completely new capability users couldn't do before?** → New Feature
2. **Does this improve/enhance something that already exists?** → Enhancement  
3. **Does this correct unintended behavior or bugs?** → Bug Fix
4. **Is this only documentation?** → Documentation

When unsure, default to Enhancement rather than New Feature.

## Output Format

Format your response exactly as:

## New Features
- [commit message] - [Brief explanation if commit message is unclear]

## Enhancements
- [commit message] - [Brief explanation if commit message is unclear]

## Bug Fixes
- [commit message] - [Brief explanation if commit message is unclear]

## Documentation
- [commit message] - [Brief explanation if commit message is unclear]

**Important:**
- Omit any commits that match exclusion criteria
- If a section has no commits, omit that section entirely
- Preserve the commit message but clarify if needed
- Add brief context only if the commit message is vague

## Commits to Categorize

{COMMITS}
```

Results:

- Consistent categorization across different repositories
- Effective filtering of internal changes
- Clear decision rules for edge cases
- Appropriate format and context
- Minimal manual cleanup needed

Accuracy: 91% - Production ready

## What changed and why

### Add examples (v1 to v3)

Problem: "Wholly new" versus "improvements" was ambiguous

Solution: Concrete examples with both positive and negative cases

Impact: +18 percentage points in accuracy

### Add keywords (v3 to v4)

Problem: AI struggling with commits using unexpected wording

Solution: Explicit keyword indicators for each category

Impact: +8 percentage points in accuracy

### Refine exclusions (v2 to v4)

Problem: Internal changes appearing in release notes

Solution: Comprehensive exclusion rules by keyword, prefix, path, and author

Impact: Reduced false positives by 85%

### Add decision rules (v4)

Problem: Edge cases with conflicting signals

Solution: Priority-based decision tree

Impact: More consistent categorization of ambiguous commits

## Metrics summary

| Version | Accuracy | False Positives | False Negatives | Review Time |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| v1 | 65% | 25% | 10% | 45 min |
| v2 | 72% | 20% | 8% | 35 min |
| v3 | 83% | 12% | 5% | 20 min |
| v4 | 91% | 4% | 5% | 12 min |

Time savings:

- Manual process: 90 minutes
- v4 automation + review: 12.5 minutes
- Saved: 77.5 minutes (86% reduction)

## Lessons learned

### What worked

1. **Concrete examples** were more effective than abstract definitions
2. **Negative examples** ("NOT this") clarified boundaries
3. **Keyword lists** helped with pattern matching
4. **Comprehensive exclusions** better than general guidelines
5. **Decision trees** resolved conflicts

### What did not work

1. Overly complex prompts (more than 2000 words) - diminishing returns
2. Too many categories (7+ categories became confusing)
3. Vague language like "generally" or "usually"
4. Assuming context the AI could not have
5. Perfection seeking (90% is often better ROI than 98%)

### Iteration strategy

1. Test with same dataset to compare versions fairly
2. Track metrics systematically (do not rely on gut feel)
3. Focus on patterns not individual failures
4. Stop iterating when improvements are less than 3 percentage points
5. Version control prompts to enable rollback

## Adapt this for your workflow

### Start with version 3

Start with v3 structure and customize:

1. Update category definitions to match your standards
2. Add examples from your actual commits
3. Customize exclusions for your repository patterns
4. Test and measure
5. Iterate based on your specific issues

### Repository-specific variations

Different repositories may need different prompts:

Frontend repository:
- More emphasis on UI or UX improvements
- Exclude styling-only changes or component refactors

Backend API repository:
- Separate category for breaking changes
- Emphasize endpoint additions or performance
- Exclude database migration details

Documentation repository:
- Simpler categorization (Content versus Structure versus Fixes)
- All commits are user-facing
- Focus on impact to readers

### Audience-specific variations

Internal release notes:
- Include infrastructure improvements
- Use technical language
- Keep some excluded items

External release notes:
- Stricter exclusions
- User-benefit focused
- Customer-friendly language

## Try it yourself

Use this prompt as your starting point:

1. Copy Version 4 to `prompts/categorization_prompt.txt`
2. Customize examples for your domain
3. Update exclusions for your repository
4. Test and measure accuracy
5. Iterate based on results
